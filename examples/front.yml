  - equation:
    - F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
  - enumerate:
      item: This is enumerate
      item: Write items in dict or list
  - some_custom_environment{arg}[optional]:
    - Key with dict or list value is interpreted as environment.
    - This works syntactically, without semantics.
