  - \maketitle
  - Let's begin with some math.
  - equation:
    - F = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
  - enumerate:
      item: This is enumerate
      item: Write items in dict or list
  - some_custom_environment{arg}[optional]:
    - Key with dict or list value is interpreted as environment.
    - This works purely syntatically, without semantics.
    - So your custom environment works out-of-box.
